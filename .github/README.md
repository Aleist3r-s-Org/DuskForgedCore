# DuskForgeCore

## Introduction

DuskForgeCore is a fork of Azerothcore an open-source game server application and framework designed for hosting massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). It is based on the popular MMORPG World of Warcraft (WoW) and seeks to recreate the gameplay experience of the original game from patch 3.3.5a.

The original code is based on MaNGOS, TrinityCore, and SunwellCore and has since then had extensive development to improve stability, in-game mechanics, and modularity to the game. AC has also grown into a community-driven project with a significant number of contributors and developers. It is written in C++ and provides a solid foundation for creating private servers that mimic the mechanics and behavior of the official WoW servers.

This core is now a joint venture between the Duskhaven and Forged Team.

## Installation

More specific detailed instructions on how to utilize the DuskForgeCore will be available once the Duskhaven Project is available for launch. It does follow the default instructions over at AzerothCore.
